    "# Data Engineering Project Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "## Preparation\n",
    "* You will need to install `boto3`\n",
    "* You will be using `pandas` and `configparser`\n",
    "* You will need to install two additional libraries to support pandas in reading from S3:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "  conda install s3fs -c conda-forge -y\n",
    "  conda install fsspec -y\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Transformations\n",
    "\n",
    "You will perform the same transformations you did in the previous class, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "* __Calculate Trip Duration in Minutes:__ Call it Trip_Duration.\n",
    "* __Calculate Total Trip Charge:__ Include fare amount, extra, MTA tax, tolls amount, improvement surcharge, congestion surcharge, airport fee, and tip amount. Call it Total_Trip_Charge.\n",
    "* __Add Trip Date Components:__ Add `Trip_Date`, `Trip_Month`, `Trip_Day`, and `Trip_Year`.\n",
    "* __Keep Specific Columns:__ `VendorID`, `passenger_count`, `trip_distance`, `store_and_fwd_flag`, `payment_type`, `Trip_Duration`, `Total_Trip_Charge`, `Trip_Date`, `Trip_Month`, `Trip_Year`, `Trip_Day`\n",
    "* __Reorder the Columns:__ Start with VendorID, followed by all the date/time columns (Date, Year, Month, and Day), then the remaining columns.\n",
    "* __Rename the Columns:__ Rename columns to Vendor_ID, No_of_Passengers, SF_Flag, Payment_Type.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Expectation Part 1\n",
    "\n",
    "* You will create functions to support your ETL Process.\n",
    "* You will need to capture some statistics for each data set you are processing for reference.\n",
    "* You will read from a source S3 bucket (raw) and write into a different S3 bucket (transformed):\n",
    "```python\n",
    "bucket_dest = 'techcatalyst-transformed'\n",
    "bucket_source = 'techcatalyst-raw'\n",
    "```\n",
    "* Make sure that your files \"objects\" are under your name inside the `techcatalyst-transformed` bucket. For example:\n",
    "s3://techcatalyst-transformed/tarek/yellow_tripdata_2024-01_transformed.parquet/Trip_Year=2024/Trip_Month=January/84e2f047dcff4f7183ae25518ecd486b-0.parquet\n",
    "* Create a function that generates an `s3://` URI. The function should take a bucket name, a file name, and then construct an `s3://` URI that points to the object. Refer to this link for more details on S3 URIs. If you forget how the `s3://` URI looks, please log in to AWS and navigate to S3 services to see how an object inside a bucket is being referenced by the `s3://` URI.\n",
    "* Create a **cleanup** function that takes three *parameters*: the DataFrame, the name of the file, and the destination bucket. The function will transform the data, then write out a Parquet file to the destination address.\n",
    "* You may need to create additional functions as necessary.\n",
    "* Finally, once you write the files to S3, you will also write your statistic file. For example., capture number of rows, number of columns, number of columns with null values, date/time of processing. What else can you think of?\n",
    "* While processing each file, it would be great to log something on the screen to show progress or status. Here is an example below:\n",

    "* Once the data has been loaded on AWS, you will need to use Athena to inspect the data to ensure correctness.\n",
    "* Remember, before using Athena, you will need to go through the process of creating the crawlers and other setup steps."
